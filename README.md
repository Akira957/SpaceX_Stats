# SpaceX_Stats

This App will show you Rockets Launched in Space for the last 13 years.

# Motivation

I was always interested in finding out what space rockets were launched succesfully, and I found out where I could get the data.

# Features

It uses express, a small amount of Graphql and Apollo without mutations, and React.js. The reason the client folder is hidden along with the React.Js code is because I built out the React Application into the public folder of the server.

# API Reference

This is a reference to the SpaceX API being used to find the Rocket Data.

# Images

This is what the opening page looks like.

# How To Use

When you open the deployed page of the app you will see a huge list of rockets that have been launched for 13 years.
On the top right you see if the mission suceeded in the green color and the launch as failed in the red color. Click on the launch details button to show The launch details of the Rocket as well as the Rocket Type that was used in the mission.
